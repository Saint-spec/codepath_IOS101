Tool Tracking App
-At my job, we have to use special tools for various jobs. There are hundreds of special tools and many drawers. We use a very slow program to look up the special tool and find its corresponding drawer number. Often the tool is out of place or in the wrong spot. My idea for the app is to keep track of the tools with a checkout system and also an easier way to find a certain tool. The user would be able to enter the special tool number and information such as drawer location, tool picture, and who used it last will be available. Also there would be a feature to edit drawer numbers if the tool is not in the correct spot or to add and remove tools.
